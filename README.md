determining the price of a shopping basket of food products using Morphology and sift

This project aims to determine the total cost of a shopping basket of food products by analyzing the images of the products in the basket. The project will use Morphology and SIFT (Scale-Invariant Feature Transform) techniques to identify and recognize individual products in the images, and then calculate their prices based on a pre-defined database of product prices.
